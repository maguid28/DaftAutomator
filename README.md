# Daft Automator

This project was developed to periodically check www.daft.ie emails to see if a new property has been posted and automatically emails the property contact with a pre-written message specified by the user.


### Prerequisites

A Gmail account and a Daft.ie account will be needed for this software to work correctly.

[Gmail account setup](https://accounts.google.com/SignUp?hl=en)

I would also recommend running this on an Amazon EC2 instance for high availabliity.

You can create an AWS account [here](https://aws.amazon.com)
